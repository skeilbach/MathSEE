# MathSEE

First steps for Heat Group:
- Lennard tries to connect SimuLink to UMBridge or create a Mockup in Python that can be connected to UMBridge
- The rest of the group writes Code to vary input parameter and generate qualitative output for sensitivity analysis

Input work ideas:
- ...

Output work ideas:
- Look for correlations between input variations and output (i.e., cor(T,i), for i = all R, all C variations)
- For correlating combinations, look into graphs
- evtl. GLM to detect most influencing parameters (exclude autocorrelated parameters > 0.45)
